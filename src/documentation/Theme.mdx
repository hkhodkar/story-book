# Theme Configuration with Tailwind CSS

In this Storybook instance, we have integrated Tailwind CSS to provide both dark and light themes for our components. This allows users to preview how components look under different themes and toggle between them for a consistent development and design experience.

## Dark and Light Themes

### Setup

The themes are implemented using Tailwind CSS utility classes and can be toggled using a theme switcher.

The project utilizes a custom Tailwind theme featuring color palettes.
