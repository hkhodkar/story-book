# CI/CD Setup with GitHub Actions

## Overview

In this project, we have implemented Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions. This setup automates the process of building, testing, and deploying our application whenever changes are pushed to the `master` branch.

## Workflow Configuration

### Trigger

Our CI/CD pipeline is triggered on every push event to the `mater` branch.

### Workflow File

The main workflow configuration is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
